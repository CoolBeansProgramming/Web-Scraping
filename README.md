# Web Scraping

I use Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a job board [site](https://www.timesjobs.com/) and save the jobs to separate files and an Excel spreadsheet. Information extracted for each job includes the company name, required experience, skills, and a link with more information about the job. I focused only on jobs that were posted in the past few days.
