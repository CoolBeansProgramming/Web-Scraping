# Web Scraping

I use Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a job board [site](https://www.timesjobs.com/) and save the information to an Excel spreadsheet and separate text files. Information extracted for each job includes the company name, required experience, skills, location, and a link with more information about the job. I focused only on listings that were posted in the past few days.
